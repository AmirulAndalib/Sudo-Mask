# Sudo-Mask
Fake sudo mask buildpack for heroku(Heroku Root buildpack)
- As we all know heroku doesn't let users to use Sudo commands or they don't have a support for sudo. Recently i was making a bot & deployed it to heroku but the problem was the needs root. I searched in google & found Fabioking's fakechroot buildpack. Tried to install it but it was broken af. It was a buildpack from 2013,so i made my own buildpack:)
A Heroku Buildpack that enables root permisions using chroot jail
